THE VERTICAL FARM INDUSTRY: EXPLORATORY RESEARCHOF A WICKED SITUATION,Simon D. Allegaert,https://edepot.wur.nl/498906,,"Increasing population, global warming, shortage of agricultural land, food security, water shortage, and other challenges are heavily weighing on the current conventional agricultural system. A disrupting new sustainable system is needed to be able to feed 9.5 billion people in 2050. A possible solution for this is vertical farming (VFing), which is growing enormously, parallel with the rise of technological innovation and  business  opportunities.  New  VFs  are  incipient  worldwide,  with  an  increasing  amount  of  capital investment.This  paper approaches  VFing  as  a  wicked  situation  and develops  atheoreticalVFbusinessframework tocreate an overview tobetter understandthe VFindustry froma researchand business-like perspective. The three main aspects of the framework are the organization (e.g. technology & innovation, geographic location, and product attributes), governance cooperation (e.g. position in the food chain and partnerships),  and  enabling  environment  (social  aspects,  government  support,  legal  aspects,  training & education). For this exploratory research, 25 participants, employed at a VF or who are active in the VF industry  (e.g. consultancy),  mainly  from  Europe  and  North  America, wereinterviewed  to  discuss  and validate the various aspects of the framework.All interviewswereanalyzed using self-determined codeswith MAXQDA to identify the importance of the VFBF aspects and to better understand the participants’ answers.The outcome of this study indicates  that  despite  continued energy and labor struggles, the VF industry carries high business potential, which is why larger corporations are investing. Independent of the degree of advanced technology, vertical farms need to produce high-qualityproductsconsistentlyto meet the greater expectations of  VF  products  and theircurrent higherprice. The  need  for  more  proven  systems and  standardization  is high,  althoughthatis  commonin growingindustries. While  automation  and advanced systems area way to drastically reduce labor costs, they alsodemandsubstantial investmentsand  energy,  especially  whenthe  technological  systemsstill needdevelopment. Participants  believea changein theenergy sector from bettermentof renewable energy will grantcheaperVF operational costs. Cheap energy willhave a large influence on the indoor farm industrybecause outside of labor, technology, and the building, energy is a major cost of operation.

"THE MOST VALUABLE SCENARIO OF
VERTICAL FARMING
BY
COMPARING DIFFERENT BUSINESS PRODUCTION
MODELS",Yutong Jiao,https://edepot.wur.nl/533244,,"By 2050, the global population is expected to be close to 10 billion persons. The huge
population will bring a huge challenge to prevent a food crisis. Due to industrial
development and urbanization, there are a lot of challenges, such as global warming,
water shortage, decreased biodiversity, air pollution, to the conventional agriculture
system. Vertical farming has been proposed as a feasible solution to release the pressure
of food shortages. Vertical farming is defined as a solution to cultivate plants in a
climate-controlled environment with dedicated light, nutrients, temperature, and other
(energy) supplies (Birkby, 2016; Benke & Tomkins, 2017). By using vertical farms,
farmers could produce all year round to supply the food consumption of urban citizens.
However, some limitations and data shortages have restricted the development of
vertical farming.
This research has adopted a diagnosis and quantitative research design. It mainly
focused on understanding better the economic limitation of vertical farming by
comparing the costs and benefits of four business production formats. Three critical
factors, namely production scale, crop, and location, have been selected as the control
factors for the model’s combination: We have adopted large scale/ very large scale,
microgreens/ lettuce, and Japan/ the U.S. A. as the three pairs of experimental factors
that constituted four business models. We plan for microgreens production in the largescale farms and lettuce production in the very large-scale farms. Thus, based on two
different locations, the analysed four business models are (1) large scale/ microgreens/
Japan; (2) very large scale/ lettuce/ Japan; (3) large scale/ microgreens/ U.S.A.; and (4)
very large scale/ lettuce/ U.S.A. For each model, we have found one typical
commercialized company as an example to relate the calculations with. So, there are
four groups of data.
Then, two extra groups of data have been added in the evaluation: one is to compare
the value of two different crops production in the same vertical farm; the other is to
compare the value of two production levels at the same scale. That adds up to six groups
of data. The outcomes suggest the following learning; the most valuable production
scale is the large scale; the most valuable crop is microgreens; the most valuable
location for lettuce is the U.S.A., while for microgreens it is Japan. We conclude that
the most valuable business production model of vertical farming would be the largescale format producing microgreens in Japan.
From the discussion derived from the calculations of each business model, it seems that
mass production can balance the annual depreciation costs and energy costs. Whereas,
if the farm’s automation facilities are insufficient, mass production will require more
labor forces, resulting in high labor costs. Therefore, to make a valuable production
3
model in the future, the vertical farm is supposed to adopt a highly automatic production
method. This is an early public comparison of costs and benefits of four very different
business production formats, thus further studies to fine-tune the economics of vertical
farms are necessary.",article,economics,
"Vertical integration: farming systems in food chain François Casabianca, Karel de Greef","François Casabianca, Karel de Greef",http://ifsa.boku.ac.at/cms/fileadmin/Books/2008_WS2_Casabianca.pdf,2008,"This workshop will discuss research based experiences of the changed conditions that farming
systems face within the whole food chain. Therefore it will focus on the environmental, social and
economic impacts of different food chains and the challenges and opportunities offered by diverse
quality schemes and standard setting organisation at the world level as well as the certification tools
implemented. The ability of diverse farm systems to enter in those schemes by adapting their features
has to be addressed, as well as the possibilities that exist for different farm types to be proactive and
competitive by taking initiatives and exploring new alternatives.
The increased globalisation of food chains, reduced protectionism and the power of food procurement
officers in large supermarket chains have a significant impact on the role of European agriculture as
well as possibilities for export-oriented farms in countries outside Europe (North Africa, Latin America,
Asia...). This calls for a better understanding of (i) farming systems in their market and supply chain
context and network and (ii) new organisation modes and standard setting at the supply chain level.
But we also have to consider local situations where trust is built upon inter-personal experiences such
as direct selling situations. Producers and customers have, in some cases, very strong relationship
through informal networks and without any trade sign. This lean integration leads us to improve our
knowledge on (i) setting up common rules at local level by enhancing the codification of farmers’
knowledge and (ii) better analyze the modalities of collective action among peers. ",article,,
